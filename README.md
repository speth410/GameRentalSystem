**Assignment:**
At least 3 students should be active (visible) in this task for your group. You should submit a few screenshots of different activity to show progress, they could be all placed in one doc or pdf OR you could submit different pics as jpg, but everything on the pic should be clearly visible.

For this task please  **share your repo**  and any  **questions or issues**  with your  **mentor**  (and if needed Wyatt  [wabyroade8918@eagle.fgcu.edu](mailto:wabyroade8918@eagle.fgcu.edu), in addition to your mentor).

Overall, I leave the specific activity to the group but the expectation is that first you will work on learning the basics of git

-   [https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf (Links to an external site.)](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
-   also see the other links at  [Links for github](https://fgcu.instructure.com/courses/509466/pages/links-for-github "Links for github")

then work on making changes, merging them, and attempt to resolve a conflict. Here are some videos and a guide made by one of our mentors:
